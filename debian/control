Description: Ruby library for rendering safe HTML and email templates
 Liquid is a secure, non-evaling end user template engine.  It has simple
 markup and beautiful results and is able to style emails as well as HTML.
 .
 It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates
 seamlessly as a plugin but it also works excellently as a stand alone library.
